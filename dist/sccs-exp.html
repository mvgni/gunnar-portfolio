My drive to get a circular professional experience in the student conduct area of student affairs was rejuvenated as I saw the concepts of alternative resolution come to life in the interactions between hearing officer and student. Watching a recent CSSA alum and new student affairs professional work in an efficient and holistic fashion helped me begin to identify the ways in which I wanted to interact with students in a conduct setting. <span class="competency-text">[Competency 5]</span></p><p>It can be difficult for me to speak to my general approach in working as a hearing officer with SCCS. The root of this can be found in that I encourage myself to practice awareness of dynamics and context with each individual student and adapt as necessary (makes sense as to why “Individualization” is my first strength). It is a professional value of mine to build up and build through our interactions with students to get to a place where both the student’s needs and the institution’s needs are represented in the outcome or resolution of a conduct process. Despite the work in the conduct office being seen as “teaching”, there are many lessons learned by students and staff in the setting which calls for the embrace of pedagogy. If I think further about my approach to the conduct-related work I do with students, I utilize thoughts from Freire’s (1972) critical pedagogy. Rather than communicate to a student that I meet with about how they should engage in their own community, I encourage the student to collaborate with me in the process where we can make a deeper meaning of the issue at hand. Following in the footsteps of hooks (1994), I bring in concepts from engaged pedagogy that emphasize the importance of creating space for a mutually enhancing experience between two active participants, rather than seeing myself as the knower of all things that serves to enforce and inform information to a passive consumer. <span class="competency-text">[Competency 3] [Competency 5]</span></p><p>This open and collaborative space that is made possible by employing critical pedagogy (Freire, 1972) is excellent for some students, but for others, it can be intimidating. After all, I spend at most 60 minutes with an individual student who by the end is most likely hoping to never have to see me again (in that context of course!...I hope). This is why the importance of being flexible and adaptable in my approach to working with students is invaluable. Another guiding principle (or in this case, theory) that I incorporate in my practice is self-authorship theory (Baxter Magolda, 2001). One element from Self-Authorship Theory that is particularly important and core to my practice is providing enough comfort that a student feels comfortable leaning into discomfort to begin the process of trusting their own inner voice and self (Baxter Magolda, 2008; Drake, Jordan, Miller, Astin, & Astin, 2013). Incorporating critical pedagogy (Freire, 1972) and self-authorship theory (Baxter Magolda, 2001), I am encouraging professional supported growth within the students that I meet with. While these frameworks might not always lead to immediate and/or permanent success, it can spark a learning process within a student that is necessary for internal growth and meaningful experiences. <span class="competency-text">[Competency 2] [Competency 3]</span></p><p>Even with the best of intentions, my approaches to my work fail if I do not first look within my own self and examine how my identities and privileges can show up and impact individuals I engage with. On a daily basis, I am working with students that have a wide range of identities that they bring with them into my office. The CSSA program has provided me opportunities to be true to the core value and principle of social justice. I have been able to take in class assignments where I reflected on my privileges and applied the importance and understanding gleaned in academic spaces into my own professional practice with students. A notable example of these reflections is found in a Critical Self-Reflection Essay that I wrote for my Multicultural Issues class. These kinds of reflections are exceptionally important for me as a student affairs professional that is navigating student conduct matters for many reasons. The first being the existing power dynamic between hearing officer and student and is inherently advanced by my many privileges if left unchecked. Secondly, it is essential to practice awareness when working with students from marginalized populations (specifically racial and ethnic minority populations) because despite the separation of student conduct and criminal justice system, there are certain parallels that require absolute attention and care to the dynamics of a situation that could be unfairly affecting students that have been historically/are currently marginalized and oppressed by higher education institutions and processes. <span class="competency-text">[Competency 1] [Competency 3] [Competency 4] [Competency 5]</span></p><div class="bottom">Made with <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> by <a href="https://connorthorson.dev">Connor</a> and Gunnar</div></div></div></main><script src="main.js"></script></body></html>
